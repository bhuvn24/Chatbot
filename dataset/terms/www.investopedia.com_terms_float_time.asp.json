Before the implementation of the [Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21),](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/check_21.asp) 1 the average float time was two to four days. Now, most checks clear within a day.\n\n## Breaking Down Float Time\n\nBefore Check 21, individuals would sometimes take advantage of long [float](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/float.asp) times and send out checks despite not having enough money in their accounts to cover the value of the checks. At times, this gave [creditors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditor.asp) the impressions that payment was available even though the individual did not have sufficient funds.\n\nIndividuals who attempt to use a check's float time in the manner previously described should be aware that doing so will likely result in several [bounced checks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bouncedcheck.asp) as float times have become dramatically shorter. Transferring checks in electronic format has hastened the clearing process.\n\n## Float Time and Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act\n\nThe _Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act_ (Check 21) took effect on October 28, 2004. It is federal law and gives banks and other organizations the ability to create electronic image copies of consumers' checks. These images are subsequently sent to the correct financial institutions for processing. From here, the institution will transfer funds from a consumer's account to the receiving party's account. Banks may destroy original paper checks following a predetermined holding period22\n\nIn general, the law aims to reduce the costs involved with paper check processing.\n\nOpen a New Bank Account\n\nAdvertiser Disclosure\n\n×\n\nThe offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation.

EMT allows users to transfer funds among personal accounts, using only email and an online banking service. EMT systems are common at the \"big five\" banks in Canada—the Royal Bank of Canada, TD Canada Trust, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Bank of Montreal, and the Scotiabank—along with other financial institutions.\n\n## Float Time and Fraudulent Check Kiting\n\nThe act of issuing or altering a check or draft with insufficient funds is fraudulent. It is called [check kiting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kited.asp). In January 2018, several deputies from Shelby County Corrections (Memphis, TN) were arrested for a check kiting scheme.3 Theft charges ranged from $1,000 to $10,000. Specifically, accusations highlight how these suspects obtained close to $7,000 from the Shelby County [Credit Union](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditunion.asp). One deputy would deposit money into the other deputies' accounts at the credit union. Together they would withdrawal funds, and the original depositor would close the account.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
