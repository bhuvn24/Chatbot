Commercial and industrial loans provide companies with funds that can be used for various purposes, including [working capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/workingcapital.asp) or to finance [capital expenditures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp) such as purchasing machinery.\n\nTypically, C&I loans have variable interest rates and are backed by collateral. As of February 2022, businesses and corporations in the United States had more than $2.48 trillion in C&I loans outstanding.1\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- A commercial and industrial (C&I) loan is a loan made to a business or corporation.\n\n- Typically, C&I loans are short-term loans with variable interest rates backed by collateral.\n- Commercial and industrial loans provide companies with funds that can be used for working capital or to finance capital expenditures such as purchasing machinery.\n- C&I loans are different from commercial real estate loans (CRE), which are mortgage loans used for commercial property purposes.\n\n## How Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Loans Work\n\nCommercial and industrial loans usually have variable rates of interest that are tied to the bank prime rate or another [benchmark](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/benchmark.asp) rate such as the [London Interbank Offered Rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp) (LIBOR). Many borrowers must also file regular [financial statements](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financial-statements.asp), which could be quarterly or annually, depending on the bank's requirements. Lenders usually require proper maintenance of the loan collateral and hold borrowers to certain covenants, such as a [debt service coverage ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dscr.asp) (DSCR).\n\nAlthough large corporations may take out C&I loans, they also have access to the financial markets for funding by issuing [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) or [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) shares. However, many small and medium-sized businesses do not have access to issuing stock shares since they may not be traded on a stock exchange. As a result, these small and mid-size companies use C&I loans to fund their [cash flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cashflow.asp) and expenditure needs.\n\nC&I loans are different from [commercial real estate loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercial-real-estate-loan.asp) (CRE), which are mortgage loans used for commercial property purposes, including offices and hotels. Businesses might also use [mini-perm loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/miniperm.asp) to cover the gap until a commercial property becomes profitable.\n\nAlso, C&I loans are not the same as [consumer loans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/consumercredit.asp) since only businesses can get commercial and industrial loans.\n\n## Pros and Cons of C&I Loans\n\nC&I loans allow businesses to bypass the typically long and arduous process of drumming up equity investors. Not only is it more costly and time-consuming to obtain equity investors, but being a publicly-traded company means being accountable to those investors and adhering to additional regulations from the U.S. [Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec.asp) (SEC). With the necessary collateral, C&I loans can help companies raise funds needed for expansion.\n\nHowever, C&I loans need to be paid off, and in some cases, within a few years. Also, if the interest rate is high, debt servicing costs can hinder a company's cash flow, taking away from the business’s working capital.\n\n## How Businesses Use C&I Loans\n\nC&I loans can be used at any time in the life of a business when it needs to generate cash. For example, a startup may take out a C&I loan to get up and running because the outlay of cash at the onset can be greater than the [revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/revenue.asp) generated from sales. The loan can be paid down as the company generates revenue.\n\nC&I loans are also useful to help businesses fund the purchase of capital property, like machinery and equipment. They can be used to purchase and renovate new facilities, buy inventory, furnish a retail store or set up a production line. The funds can also be used to join a competitor or supplier in a [joint venture](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/jointventure.asp).\n\n## Tracking C&I Loans\n\nThe [Federal Reserve Board of Governors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/frb.asp) keeps track of all C&I loans in the country. Growth in C&I loan outstanding tends to correlate with [Gross Domestic Product](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gdp.asp) (GDP) growth. Economic downturns and [recessions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recession.asp) can impact the level of C&I loan issuance.\n\nAlso, banks tend to reduce the supply of C&I loans when there's an increase in [credit risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditrisk.asp) or the risk that the borrower may [default](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/default2.asp) on the loan. For example, in a recession, companies may suffer a decline in revenue due to less demand for their product or service. If companies cannot repay the loans, banks may cut the supply of new C&I loans. As a result, monitoring new C&I loan issuance and the number of loans in default can be an effective indicator of the financial health of companies and the overall economy.2\n\n_Correction—April 1, 2022:_ A previous version of this article misstated the total amount of outstanding C&I loans in the U.S.\n\nArticle Sources\n\nInvestopedia requires writers to use primary sources to support their work.
